Source code for "A Double-Graph Based Framework for Frame Semantic Parsing" @ NAACL 2022
## Overview
TL;DR: A framework for frame semantic parsing aims to utilize double-graph structure to inject knowledge into parsing and strengthen interacrions between arguments.

Paper Link: [A Double-Graph Based Framework for Frame Semantic Parsing](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=STUnTbwKMXm), TODO: replace it with camera-ready version.

We find Ontological Frame Knowledge can contribute to frame semantic parsing by both intra-frame and inter-frame reasoning. To make use of it, we build FKG (Frame Knowledge Graph) on definitions of FEs, frame relations and FE mappings.
