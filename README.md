Source code for "A Double-Graph Based Framework for Frame Semantic Parsing" @ NAACL 2022
## Overview
TL;DR: A framework for frame semantic parsing aims to utilize double-graph structure to inject knowledge into parsing and strengthen interacrions between arguments.

Paper Link: [A Double-Graph Based Framework for Frame Semantic Parsing](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=STUnTbwKMXm), TODO: replace it with camera-ready version.

We find Ontological Frame Knowledge can contribute to frame semantic parsing by both intra-frame and inter-frame reasoning. To make use of it, we build FKG (Frame Knowledge Graph) on definitions of FEs, frame relations and FE mappings. Besides, 

## Requirments

## How to Run Our Code?
### Datapreprocess
You can get all data files from scratch, we will also provide links to download these data files in future.


First, run `data_preprocess.py` to get data_instance_dic and word/lemma vectors from [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
```
python data_preprocess.py
```
